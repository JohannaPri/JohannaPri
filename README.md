 # Hi, I'm Johanna! 
 
***I'm a 31-year-old aspiring Frontend Developer from Sweden, currently studying at Medieinstitutet, where I‚Äôll graduate in the spring of 2025.***

Creativity has always been a driving force for me, and throughout my studies, my passion for design has grown even stronger. While frontend development offers many possibilities, I‚Äôm especially excited about exploring a career where I can blend my technical skills with my love for design. Both graphic and visual design have captured my interest, and I‚Äôm excited to deepen my skills in crafting graphic and visual designs that not only captivate users but also ensure intuitive, user-friendly interactions.

I'm also interested in agile project management, which has been a key part of my learning process. Working within agile frameworks has given me insight into how to lead and collaborate effectively on dynamic projects.

I‚Äôm excited to keep expanding my skills and taking on new challenges that allow me to blend design, development, and project management. 
I welcome the chance to work internationally while having the option for remote work and travel when necessary.

**Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate‚ÄîI'd love to hear from you!**
